      "content": "# Variance Analysis Report - July 2023\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe analysis of the July 2023 P&L identified a significant material anomaly in the Marketing department's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). A total unfavorable variance of $175,631.01 was investigated and traced to a classification error in the source ledger.\n\n## Key Findings\n### 1. COGS Misclassification in Marketing (Finding ID: F-001)\n- **Root Cause**: Six journal entries (IDs 512-517) for Direct Materials and Direct Labor were incorrectly coded to the Marketing department.\n- **Impact**: This resulted in a 3324% variance relative to the monthly budget of $5,282.\n- **Evidence**: The anomaly was traced from the `mart_pnl_report` down to specific line items in `raw_ledger_entries`.\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Immediate Action**: Reclassify the identified entries to the correct production department.\n- **Process Improvement**: Implement a validation rule to prevent COGS accounts from being booked to non-production departments like Marketing without manual override.\n",
